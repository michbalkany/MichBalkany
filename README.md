### Hi there! My name is Michael Balkany, most people call me Mich 👋

I am a newly certified Full-Stack Developer and Licensed manufacturer for Edibles in the Cannabis industry. Programming, surfing, studying about cannabis, and meeting new people are a few things i love to include in my daily life.

As a developer, learning how to figure out new challenges pushes me to think differently. It is a new addition to my daily goals i strive to reach. i am learning how to step out of my circle to connect, create, and conquer. that includes learning an unfamiliar language for collaborated projects, connect with other developers in similar environments, and learn better practices for coding.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an interactive-map web application that will connect local entrepreneurs in the cannabis industry, for professional purposes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to improve my software development, and IOS development skills.
